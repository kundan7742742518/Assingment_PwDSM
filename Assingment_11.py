Because files are limited resources managed by the operating system, 
making sure files are closed after use will protect against hard-to-debug 
issues like running out of file handles or experiencing corrupted data. 
The best defense is always to open files with a context manager.

Write 
The write() method writes a specified text to the file.
Where the specified text will be inserted depends on the file mode and stream position.
"a":  The text will be inserted at the current file stream position, default at the end of the file.
"w": The file will be emptied before the text will be inserted at the current file stream position, default 0.
:- Use in bytes 
writelines 
he writelines() method writes the items of a list to the file.
Where the texts will be inserted depends on the file mode and stream position.
"a":  The texts will be inserted at the current file stream position, default at the end of the file.
"w": The file will be emptied before the texts will be inserted at the current file stream position, default 0.
